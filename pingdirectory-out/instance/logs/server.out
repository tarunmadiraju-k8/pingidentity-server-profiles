This non-zero setting allows Linux to swap temporarily inactive parts of the JVM out of memory to disk.  When the JVM later accesses large amounts of this swapped out memory (for instance during a garbage collection cycle), the server can experience pauses of several seconds where no processing occurs.  We strongly recommend setting this value to '0' by executing 'sysctl -w vm.swappiness=0' as root to change the current value in the operating system and by adding a line 'vm.swappiness = 0' to /etc/sysctl.conf to ensure that the correct setting is applied when the system restarts. If a system performance service such as tuned is used, also apply the vm.swappiness setting to the active profile or disable the service.
